          <h3>But don't take it from us</h3>
          <p>Here's what our clients have had to say:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>As an artist, I have strong opinions about how I want my works of art to appear in public.  I shared my design thoughts with Herb which he translated beautifully into a web design that complimented and enhanced my style.</p>
             <p>Herb communicated his concepts and gave me possibilities from which I could extrapolate and tweak the design without feeling threatened or uncomfortable.  Overall, it was a great experience working with him to create a web site for my art work.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Yea, these guys pretty much rocked my balls off. I was in a comma for 4 months after seeing the site they built for me. While I was under, my business prospered, and eventually became sentient and founded the Avengers Initiative. I awoke with a freshly baked pizza on my lap. It was marvelous.</p>
